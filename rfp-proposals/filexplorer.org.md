# Project Description

Filexplorer.org (a play on words between the token name of FIL and explorer resulting in FIL(e)xplorer) is a proposed easy to use, visually appealing, streamlined, and developer + consumer friendly block explorer for Filecoin.

Built with the common principles of block explorers in mind, it aims to be a two-part implementation:

1. A simple, dynamic, and responsive web-based tool that reads metadata from the blockchain and displays it in a digestable format, in real-time. Similar to existing solutions for other currencies (think [Blockchain.com Explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer), [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), and [LibExplorer](https://libexplorer.com/)), the tool would provide a clear view of the state of the network, and allow users to visually interact with and manipulate historic (and real-time) data from the blockchain.
2. While not directly requested in the RFP, a part of building such a web-based tool would involve utilizing a Filecoin node and interacting with it via HTTP requests. Thus, for developers and Filecoin data enthusiasts, Filexplorer.org would also expose a real-time development REST API which can be used to conveniently integrate the block explorers data into other applications built by developers on Filecoin (many existing block explorers already do this, for example, [Blockchain.com API](https://www.blockchain.com/api/blockchain_api), [Etherscan API](https://etherscan.io/apis), [LibExplorer API](https://libexplorer.com/apis)).

Besides this, the scope provided in the RFP has been fully realized and understood. The core metrics (including wallet addresses, node information, message detail, transaction data, block height, block time) will be delivered, alongside various additional metrics such as historic supply, 24h statistics (volume, market cap, transactions), number of active nodes, etc.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. You can use the milestones suggested in the RFP or create your own. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:

- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the RFP scope.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Total Budget Requested

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Ensure that it does not exceed the total funding limit on the RFP.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.
